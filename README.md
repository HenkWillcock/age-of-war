## Infantry

### Pawn

Crap at fighting, but great for taking down the enemy's lives if you can get them to their base.

### Ninja

Can jump over helicopter bullets, and can jump to take down helicopters and harriers. Invisible to helicopters and cannons.

### Commando

TODO, something badass. One of: mind-control, 

## Vehicles

### Tank

Can bump off multiple pawns, but only worth 1 life if you get it to the enemies base.
Won't move if it's flipped over.
Benchmark: Should be able to consistently take out 5 pawns.

### Heli

Can take out many tanks and pawns, but is vulnerable to cannons. Can't see ninjas to fire at them. Takes a while to take off, its vulnerable during this time.
Benchmark: Should be able to consistently take out 2 tanks at once.

### Harrier

Sits at your base to recharge. Can then perform airstrikes and return to your base.

## Structures

### Bank

Increases income by $5 per 5 seconds.

### Cannon

Takes out one unit, then needs to wait 10 seconds to recharge. Very effective against heli.
Benchmark: Should have more range than heli.

### Nuke

Clears the board and takes one life off your opponent.

## TODO

 - Add UI for building, not just buttons.
 - Multiplayer on different machines.
 - Main menu
 - AI Opponent
