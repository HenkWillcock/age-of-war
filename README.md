## Commands

`./Unity/Hub/Editor/2019.1.8f1/Editor/Unity`

`sudo killall -9 Unity`

## Units

### Pawn

Crap at fighting, but great for taking down the enemy's lives if you can get them to their base.

### Tank

Can bump off multiple pawns, but only worth 1 life if you get it to the enemies base.

### Chopper

Flies over enemies.

### Cannon

Takes out one unit, then needs to wait 10 seconds to recharge.

### Nuke

Clears the board and takes one life off your opponent.

## TODO

 - Add UI for building, not just buttons.
 - Multiplayer on different machines.
 - Helicopter
 - Finish cannon
 - Main menu
 - AI Opponent
