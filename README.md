## Commands

#### Start Unity
`~/./Unity/Hub/Editor/2019.1.8f1/Editor/Unity`

#### Stop Unity
`sudo killall -9 Unity`

## Infantry

### Pawn

Bad at fighting, but very cheap so great for taking cannon shots and taking down the enemy's lives if you can get them to their base. Can also repair damaged vehicles.

### Ninja

Can jump over ground units, and can jump to take down flying units. Invisible to helicopters and cannons.

### Commando

TODO, something badass. One of: mind-control, 

## Vehicles

### Tank

Can bump off many pawns, but only worth 1 life if you get it to the enemies base. Weak against helicopters. Won't move if it's flipped over.

Benchmark: Should be able to consistently take out 5 pawns.

### Heli

Can take out many tanks and pawns, but is vulnerable to cannons and ninjas. Takes a while to take off when first bought, is vulnerable during this time.
Benchmark: Should be able to consistently take out 2 tanks at once.

### Harrier

Sits at your base to recharge. Can then perform airstrikes against the nearest enemy and return to your base.

## Structures

### Bank

Increases income by $5 per 5 seconds.

### Cannon

Takes out one unit, then needs to wait 10 seconds to recharge. Very effective against heli.
Benchmark: Should have more range than heli.

### Nuke

Clears the board and takes one life off your opponent.

## TODO

 - Add UI for building, not just buttons.
 - Multiplayer on different machines.
 - Main menu
 - AI Opponent
